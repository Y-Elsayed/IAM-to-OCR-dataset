# IAM-OCR-Pair-Generator

**IAM-OCR-Pair-Generator** is Python toolkit designed to transform full IAM form images into ready-to-use OCR training pairs. The tool automatically segments IAM form images into 
distinct regionsâ€”extracting the printed label text from the top and isolating the handwritten paragraph as the input image. This automated pairing creates a dataset of `{image, label}` entries suitable for training and evaluating handwriting recognition models.
